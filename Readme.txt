Circuit Wars Readme

March 2017

INTRODUCTION:
Protons are attacking your circuit fort!
Rally electrons to fix the breaks!
Collect blue charges for random positive or negative effects!
Don't let the battery drain!

RUNNING THE GAME:
We have provided a Windows build (Circuit Wars.exe), located in the Builds subfolder and tested for validity.
It must be run with 1920x1080 resolution to display as intended, due to the unpredictable way Unity's UI scales to
different resolutions.  Builds to other platforms took upwards of 20 minutes and then would not run when launched.

ASSETS:
All current art produced by Gillian.
"arrow_break" came from the Drexel sound library.
"JacobsLadderSingle1.wav" sound effect by Halleck of Freesound.org is used under a Creative Commons license.
"laser.wav" by kafokafo of Freesound.org is used under a Creative Commons license.
"techno-loop.wav" by zagi2 of Freesound.ord used under a Creative Commons license.

CHANGES SINCE BETA:
-Final sprites and animations added.
-Adjusted values so the game gets harder faster.
-Power-ups are now "blind" so player won't know if their effects are positive or negative until collecting them.
This adds a different level of agency since the player can choose to avoid them completely or take a chance.
-Major code cleanup and better testing.
